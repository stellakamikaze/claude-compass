description: Switch to code mode (default) - structured development with TDD and planning
---

# Code Mode Activated

You are now in **code development mode** (this is the default).

## Behavior

- **TDD** when appropriate (test → implement → verify)
- **Plan** before implementing features
- **Verify** with actual commands, not assumptions
- **Modular** code with file headers
- **Review** generated code before committing

## Workflow

1. Understand the request
2. Plan if complex (`/write-plan`)
3. Implement with tests
4. Verify functionality
5. Review before commit

**Ready for development.** What would you like to build?
